<div class="container"><h3><strong> Hello There! </strong> I'm glad to see you've found my website.  My name is Mary Kelly, but please just call me Mary. I am a front-end web developer and aspiring graphic designer currently residing in Tallahassee, Florida.  I am a graduate of The Florida State University, with a Bachelor of Science in Sociology. You're probably thinking, "What the hell is a sociology major doing in web development?" Well, to answer that question, I took quite the array of random classes and have a minor in both Computer Science and Psychology. I found my passion for web development late in my college career, but when I discovered it, I ran with it, and here I am today. <br><br>
I love to learn and sink my fangs into a project... something about coding gets my excitement soaring. I am a rescourceful, hard worker and I will stop at nothing to complete a challenge placed in front of me (perhaps that's why I love web development so much). My strongest skills include HTML/CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. I have experience in AngularJS as well.  On the graphic design end, my powers in Illustrator and Photoshop grow stronger every day.<br><br>
What am I currently up to? I am working for Opphub Inc., as a front-end web developer and spend a lot of my free time in coffee shops, boning up on various languages and design programs. Are you intrigued? Contact me at one of the sources below (to be updated)! Thanks for dropping by!
